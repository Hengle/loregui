//! # lore-vm
//!
//! GUI-agnostic view-model core over the [Lore](https://github.com/EpicGames/lore)
//! version-control system. This crate is the reusable foundation: the standalone
//! `loregui` Tauri app consumes it today, and StudioBrain's desktop app can embed
//! the same crate later (the model-manager pattern — standalone, but also wraps in).
//!
//! Everything funnels through one trait, [`backend::LoreBackend`], with two
//! implementations selected by feature flag:
//! - `cli-backend` (default): shells to the `lore` CLI. Works immediately.
//! - `client-backend`: links `lore-client` in-process. The destination; stubbed.
