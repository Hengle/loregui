//! `lock file_acquire_as_owner` operation — binds `lore::lock::file_acquire_as_owner`.
//!
//! Acquires exclusive locks on one or more files on behalf of a specified owner.
//! Same as `file_acquire` but allows specifying who the lock is being acquired for.
//! Emits `LockFileAcquire` events for each successfully acquired lock,
//! and `LockFileAcquireIgnore` events for each file already owned by that owner.
