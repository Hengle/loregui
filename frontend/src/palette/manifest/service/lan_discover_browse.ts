/**
 * Command-palette manifest entry for `service: discover servers on LAN`
 * (SBAI-4073).
 *
 * Open-core, NOT gated: dynamic mDNS/zeroconf discovery (the same pattern
 * studiobrain-model-manager uses for gateway clustering). Starts (or reuses) a
 * background browse for lore servers advertised on the local network and returns
 * the list seen so far — each entry carries a friendly name, repo, host, and the
 * `lore://host:port/<repo>` URL a client connects with. The connect/onboarding
 * flow ("Servers on your network") is the rich surface; this palette row is the
 * universal way to trigger a scan from anywhere (Ctrl-K). No arguments.
